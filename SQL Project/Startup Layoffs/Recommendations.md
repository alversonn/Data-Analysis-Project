# Startup Layoffs

## About

This project aims to explore insights into layoffs data from 3,626 entries, focusing on total layoffs, percentage laid off, and funds raised. The data source comes from Kaggle, with information available from the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, to May 30, 2024. The dataset includes startup layoffs reported on Layoffs.fyi since COVID-19.

Conducting comprehensive data cleaning using MySQL involved identifying and removing duplicates, standardizing data, correcting errors, addressing null values, and eliminating unnecessary columns and rows. New tables were created to streamline the dataset and ensure consistency and accuracy for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to explore the dataset, identify trends, uncover patterns, and analyze key metrics such as total layoffs, percentage laid off, and funds raised. Advanced SQL queries were executed to determine companies with the highest layoffs by year, calculate rolling totals of layoffs per month, and group and summarize data by various dimensions, including company, location, industry, stage, and country.

## Step by Step
1. **Data Wrangling**
  - Build a database.
  - Create table and insert the data.
  - Data Cleaning:
	 1. Remove Duplicates
	 2. Standarize Data
	 3. Null/Blank Values
	 4. Remove any Columns
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**


## Recommendations

1. Geographical Economic Support
Recommendation: Regions with high layoff counts should receive targeted economic support and job creation initiatives to counteract the impact of these layoffs.

2. Industry-Specific Strategies
Recommendation: Industries facing significant layoffs should be evaluated for specific challenges, and industry-wide strategies should be developed to address underlying issues, such as technological advancements or market shifts.

3. Yearly Trend Analysis
Recommendation: Yearly layoff trends should be analyzed to forecast future layoffs and prepare mitigation strategies. Understanding the temporal patterns can help in better resource allocation and economic planning.

4. Support for Vulnerable Business Stages
Recommendation: Companies at particular stages of growth that are more prone to layoffs should receive targeted support, such as financial counseling or operational assistance, to help them stabilize and grow sustainably.

5. Monthly Layoff Tracking
Recommendation: Implementing a system to track layoffs monthly and maintain a rolling total can help in early detection of increasing layoff trends, enabling quicker response to emerging economic issues.


By analyzing layoff data across various dimensions, we gain critical insights into the most affected companies, regions, industries, and time periods. Implementing targeted strategies based on these insights can help mitigate the impact of layoffs and promote economic stability.
